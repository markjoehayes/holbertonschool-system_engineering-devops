For every additional element, why you are adding it:

    Three Firewalls

        Load Balancer Firewall: Protects entire infrastructure from external threats, filters malicious traffic before it reaches web servers

        Web Server Firewalls: Host-based firewalls (iptables/ufw) on each web server for defense in depth, limits internal lateral movement

        Database Server Firewall: Restricts database access to only web servers, prevents unauthorized connections

    SSL Certificate for HTTPS

        Why added: Encrypts data between users and website, protects sensitive information (login credentials, personal data)

        Benefits: Prevents eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, required for modern web standards, improves SEO rankings

    Three Monitoring Clients

        Why added: Collect performance data, logs, and metrics from each server component

        Benefits: Enables proactive issue detection, performance optimization, capacity planning, and troubleshooting

What are firewalls for:

    Network Security: Filter incoming/outgoing traffic based on predefined rules

    Access Control: Allow/deny traffic based on IP addresses, ports, protocols

    Threat Prevention: Block malicious traffic (DDoS attempts, port scans, attack patterns)

    Segmentation: Isolate different parts of infrastructure (web tier from database tier)

    Compliance: Meet security standards and regulatory requirements

Why is the traffic served over HTTPS:

    Encryption: Prevents eavesdropping on sensitive data (passwords, credit cards, personal info)

    Data Integrity: Ensures data isn't modified during transmission

    Authentication: Verifies website identity, prevents phishing sites

    Trust: Browser padlock icon builds user confidence

    SEO Benefits: Google ranks HTTPS sites higher

    Modern Requirement: Many web features (geolocation, service workers) require HTTPS

    Regulatory Compliance: Required by GDPR, PCI-DSS, etc.

What monitoring is used for:

    Performance Tracking: Monitor response times, resource usage, throughput

    Availability: Ensure services are up and responding

    Capacity Planning: Identify when to scale resources

    Troubleshooting: Diagnose issues quickly with historical data

    Security: Detect anomalous patterns or attacks

    Business Metrics: Track user behavior, conversion rates

    Compliance: Maintain audit trails and logs

How the monitoring tool is collecting data:

Sumo Logic (as example) collection methods:

    Agents/Clients:

        Installed on each server (web servers, database, load balancer)

        Continuously collect system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)

        Forward application logs and access logs

    Collection Methods:

        Log Files: Tails and forwards log files (Nginx access/error logs, application logs, MySQL logs)

        System Metrics: Uses OS tools (proc filesystem, system APIs) to gather resource usage

        Application Metrics: Custom instrumentation via SDKs or agents

        Network Metrics: Collects from load balancer and firewall logs

    Transport:

        Encrypted connection to Sumo Logic collectors

        Batch processing for efficiency

        Compression to reduce bandwidth

    Data Processing:

        Parsing structured and unstructured logs

        Extracting fields and patterns

        Correlating events across servers
