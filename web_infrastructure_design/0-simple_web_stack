What is a server?

A server is a physical or virtual computer system that provides resources, services, or functionality to other computers (clients) over a network. In this infrastructure, it's a single machine hosting all components needed to run the website.

What is the role of a domain name?

The domain name foobar.com provides a human-readable address that maps to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8) through DNS. It allows users to access the website using an easy-to-remember name instead of a numerical IP address.

What type of DNS record is www in www.foobar.com?

The www record is typically a CNAME record (Canonical Name) that points to foobar.com, which then has an A record pointing to 8.8.8.8.

What is the role of the web server?

The web server (Nginx):

   - Listens for HTTP/HTTPS requests on ports 80/443

   - Serves static content (images, CSS, JavaScript files) directly

    - Acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding dynamic requests to the application server

    - Can handle SSL/TLS termination

    -  Manages load balancing (though minimal in single-server setup)


What is the role of the database?

The database (MySQL):

   - Stores and manages persistent data (user accounts, content, transactions)

   - Provides structured data storage with tables, rows, and columns

   -  Handles data retrieval, insertion, updates, and deletion

    - Ensures data integrity and can manage relationships between data

    - Processes queries from the application server

7. How does the server communicate with the user's computer?

The server communicates with users' computers using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol over TCP/IP. When a user requests www.foobar.com:

    - DNS resolution converts the domain to IP 8.8.8.8

    - The browser establishes a TCP connection to port 80/443 on 8.8.8.8

    - HTTP requests are sent and responses are returned

    - Data is transmitted in packets over the internet using various networking protocols


Issues with This Infrastructure

1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

    Entire infrastructure depends on one server: If the server fails (hardware failure, power outage, network issues), the website becomes completely unavailable

    Database on same server: If MySQL crashes, the entire application goes down

    No redundancy: No backup server to take over if the primary fails

2. Downtime During Maintenance

    Code deployments require restarts: When deploying new application code, the application server often needs to restart, causing service interruption

    Server updates: OS updates, security patches, or web server updates require reboots

    Database maintenance: Schema changes or database optimizations require taking the site offline

    Zero-downtime deployments are impossible with this architecture

3. Cannot Scale with Increased Traffic

    Limited resources: Single server has fixed CPU, RAM, disk I/O, and network bandwidth

    Database bottleneck: As traffic increases, MySQL becomes a performance bottleneck since it shares resources with the web and application servers

    No horizontal scaling: Cannot add more servers to distribute load

    Traffic spikes can crash the server: Sudden increases in traffic (from marketing campaigns, social media mentions) can overwhelm the server

    Geographic limitations: Users far from the server location experience higher latency

Additional Concerns:

    Security: Compromise of one component can lead to full system compromise

    Backup challenges: Running backups affects performance since all services compete for resources

    Monitoring limitations: Difficult to isolate performance issues when all components are bundled

    Vendor lock-in: Dependent on a single hosting provider or physical location
